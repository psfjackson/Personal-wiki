Hi, I'm Phill. I am an aspiring software developer. These are my notes for my studies in software development. 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/psfjackson), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PhillipsJackson) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11658768/phillip-jackson).

## What notes I keep

This site documents my notes from my developments in software developement. The notes on here are predominetly related to software development on a Linux computer. 

## How this site works

I keep notes in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) format, and build them as documentation pages using [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/). You can find the published wiki [here](https://wiki.psfjackson.com/) and the corresponding Github repo [here](https://github.com/psfjackson/personal-wiki).

Please feel free to make a [Github pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you think I could make any corrections or improvements.
